// Package webui embeds the built web/ SPA and serves it same-origin from
// the platform binary — production assets embed and serve straight from
// the Go binary — with client-side-route SPA fallback so a
// direct navigation or hard refresh on e.g. /admin/setup still loads.
//
// go:embed can only reach files under this module tree, and web/dist does
// not exist at a bare `go build` (it is a separate npm package, built
// separately). So dist/ here is a real, checked-in directory, but its build
// output is gitignored — only an empty placeholder dist/.gitkeep is tracked
// (the `all:` embed prefix includes dotfiles, so .gitkeep alone satisfies the
// directive). That keeps `go build`/`go test` from ever depending on a web
// build existing, while ensuring a release build never dirties a tracked
// file: a real deployment (or server/e2e/run_e2e.sh, for the live-smoke
// suite) copies the actual web/dist build — index.html plus hashed assets —
// over it before building the platform binary. Either way this package embeds
// whatever is on disk at `go build` time; the two "real embedded build" tests
// skip when only the placeholder is present.

// paths nothing else matched. An unmatched /api/* path still 404s as JSON
// rather than falling through to the SPA — only unmatched GET/HEAD requests
// outside /api/ get the SPA treatment.
//
// Static assets (JS/CSS/images — anything that exists as a real file in
// the embedded tree) are served as-is with their normal content type and
// caching headers via http.FileServer; everything else falls back to
// index.html so react-router's client-side routes resolve.
//
// Every response this handler serves gets auth.SetSPASecurityHeaders, NOT
// the API's auth.SetSecurityHeaders: the SPA build now authors
// its own fetch-directive CSP in a build-time <meta> tag (including the
// Solana RPC origin, a value this server no longer knows at all), so the
// header this handler sends must not re-cap those directives — see
// SPAContentSecurityPolicy's doc comment.
