// ReconcileMinted scans indexed SupplyController Minted events for
// (chainID, controllerAddr) and flips any matching Pending/Signed
// AssetRecord to Minted. Anyone may submit the valid signature to
// SupplyController.mint, and tokens are minted only to the Vault. Matching is
// by RecordKey since Minted carries recordKey, not recordId, and
// record.RecordKey was computed and stored at CreateRecord time. Safe to call
// repeatedly: already-Minted records backed by a surviving event are left
// alone.
//
// The projection is reversible: a record promoted to Minted by a prior call
// is DEMOTED back to Signed if its backing Minted event is no longer
// present — e.g. an indexer reorg rollback (internal/indexer) discarded it
// because it was orphaned. chainEvents only ever holds events the indexer
// currently considers canonical, so "no surviving event for this
// RecordKey" is exactly the condition that must be reflected here; this
// reconciler must not be append-only or a rolled-back mint would leave a
// record permanently (and incorrectly) stuck at Minted.

// ReconcileAuditor projects indexed SupplyController AuditorChanged events
// for (chainID, controllerAddr) onto RecordService's live auditor address.
// A rotation performed on-chain via SupplyController.setAuditor — outside
// this server, e.g. by the admin/
// multisig — otherwise never reaches a running process: BuildPackage and
// RelaySignedResult would keep attesting/verifying against whatever
// auditor was known at construction (or activation) time, producing
// packages/verifications the contract's mint() now rejects (WrongAuditor).
// Safe to call repeatedly: it only ever applies the most recent event
// (by (blockNumber,logIndex), the order ListByName returns) and setting
// the same address again is a no-op.
//
// If NO surviving AuditorChanged event exists — the rotation that set the
// currently-live auditor was itself rolled back by a reorg
// (indexer.Indexer.rollback deletes the underlying chain_events row
// entirely, it does not merely flag it Removed) — this restores
// baselineAuditor (the deployment-time value RecordService was
// constructed with) rather than leaving the live auditor stuck at an
// address with no on-chain record justifying it anymore. Previously this
// returned nil without restoring anything, so the service kept
// creating/verifying packages against the orphaned auditor until restart
// or another rotation.
